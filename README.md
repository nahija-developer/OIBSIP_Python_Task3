Project Title: Weather Detection App using API

ðŸ“– Objective
The aim of this project is to create a Python-based application that fetches and displays real-time weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. This task enhances skills in API integration, JSON data handling, and user input processing in Python.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Core concepts)

requests module

OpenWeatherMap API

JSON

VS Code / PyCharm (IDE)

ðŸš€ Steps Performed

Collected the API key from OpenWeatherMap.

Captured user input for city name.

Sent API requests using the requests module.

Parsed and extracted required weather details from the JSON response.

Displayed information such as temperature, weather condition, and humidity.

Handled edge cases for invalid city names and network errors.

âœ… Outcome
This project demonstrates how to fetch and display live data using third-party APIs. It helped strengthen my skills in Python programming, working with web APIs, and managing JSON data.
